# route-pattern [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/smikhalevski/route-pattern.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/smikhalevski/route-pattern)

The path pattern parser, that supports named variables, variable constraints, bash-like alternation, regular expressions, and wildcards.

This package is tiny and has no dependencies. [Just 2 kB gzipped.](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@smikhalevski/route-pattern) 

```sh
npm install --save-prod @smikhalevski/route-pattern
```

# Usage

```ts
import {convertPatternToRegExp} from '@smikhalevski/route-pattern';

const re = convertPatternToRegExp('/(\\d+)/:foo{ bar, qux }');
const match = re.exec('/123/bar');

console.log(match?.groups?.foo); // â†’ 'bar'
```

The support of named capturing groups **is not required** from the environment.

# Features

1. `/foo/bar` is a literal path that is matched as is.

1. Spaces, tabs and newlines are ignored, so `/ foo / bar` is the same as `/foo/bar`, and `/foo  bar` is the same
   as `/foobar` (note the absent spaces).

1. If you want to preserve spaces, use quotes: `/" foo bar"`.

1. `(\\d+)` declares a regular expression, spaces have a meaning inside regular expression.

1. `*` declares a wildcard that matches everything except path separator. For example, `/foo/*/bar` would
   match `/foo/okay/bar` but won't match `/foo/no/sir/bar`.

1. `**` declares a greedy wildcard that matches everything, even path separators. For example, `/foo/**/bar` would match
   both `/foo/okay/bar` and `/foo/no/sir/bar`.

1. `{ foo, bar }` declares an alternation: `foo` or `bar`.

1. Alternation supports nesting, for example `/foo{ -bar, /(\\d+)/qux }` would match `/foo-bar` and `/foo/123/qux`.

1. `:foo` declares a variable. Variable name should match `^[A-Za-z0-9$_]+$`.

1. `:foo_www` would read variable with name `foo_www`. To prevent unexpected parsing surround string literals with
   quotes. For example, `:foo _www` and `:foo"_www"` would both read variable `foo` and treat `_www` as a string
   literal.

1. `:foo(\\d+)` declares a variable whose value is restricted to a regular expression.

1. `:foo{ a, b }` declares a variable whose value is restricted to an alternation.

1. `:foo{**}` variables can be restricted with wildcards.

1. Variables can be nested: `/aaa/ :foo{ /bbb, /ccc/:bar }`.
